**Deliverable 4**
- Assets: For my icons, I got my shared, map, and precipitation icon from SVG Repo. For my animated weather svg icons, I got it from this repository: https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons
- I referenced MDN web docs, Geeks for Geeks, and stack overflow for most of the documentation of the program I wrote (especially for styles.css). Specifically, I used MDN web docs for documentation on the :nth-child() psuedo class and the :root psuedoclass which I used for my calendar item UI and general variable naming. Geeks for Geeks for GitHub shenanigans, and stack overflow for some padding and margin issues.
- I had a really hard time trying to reproduce the schedule lines UI in the schedule component of my weather app, so I used ChatGPT 01 as reference to create these lines while manually positioning them and defining their margins and alignment to the time labels myself.
- I learned a lot from this project! It was really fun prototyping all this.
